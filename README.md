# MBasiC
A very simple, function over fashion, Apple Silicon native Minecraft launcher.
*(I plan for the scope of this to hopefully expland in the future, with support for intel macs and maybe even Linux / Windows)* 
### Description
This is a python based *command line launcher* to launch most any minecraft version natively on Apple Silicon based Macs, *such as the M1, M1 Pro, or M1 Max Macs (try saying that five times fast)*
### Use
Simply download one of the offical releases, and run the app to launch the command line interface. For different command usage, refer to the wiki
